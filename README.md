# My Linux, Python API & Security Project

## Overview
This project demonstrates my practical experience with Linux, Python programming, API integration, and IT security. The goal was to develop a series of automation scripts that address system management tasks, API data retrieval, and security protocols.

## Features
- **Linux Scripts:**
  - Clean old log files to free up disk space.
  - Check and report available disk space on the system.
  
- **Python API Scripts:**
  - Fetch data from external APIs (e.g., weather data) and integrate it into system analysis.
  
- **IT Security:**
  - Automate the creation of SSH keys for secure server access.
  - Configure firewall rules using iptables to block malicious traffic.

## Technologies Used
- **Linux** (Bash scripting)
- **Python** (for API integration and system management)
- **IT Security** (SSH keys, iptables)

## Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/otmanedd/my-linux-python-api-security-project.git
